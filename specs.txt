checkboxes clunky
previous next - maybe outside of box, maybe make it vertical
either radio buttons or checkboxes (should look the same)
pending/public libraries should show user

-----

notes:

parent components -
quizzes, admin, profile

quizzes
	- quizzes
		- take a quiz -> quiz session
		- review previous quizzes -> attempt (dialog, looks like quiz session)
	- libraries
		- my libraries
		- public libraries
		- library view (after clicking from above two)


admin
	- add account
	- deactivate account
	- approve/deny library

profile
	- view profile
	- edit information

displaying questions:
like "quiz session" for active quiz
accordion for attempts/library
edit buttons in library view

------

move profile-navbar to components
rename classes to models
consolidate services

console logs need to be cleaned up - in staging
